  "excerpt": "Schwingerkönig Christian Stucki is our newest ambassador. If Switzerland's strongest man can be convinced, anyone can.",
  "content": "We didn't choose Christian Stucki because he's a vegetarian. We chose him because he isn't. The 2019 Schwingerkönig knows what good meat tastes like — and he was blown away by planted. His message is simple: you don't have to give up taste to eat more sustainably. 'Approved by Meat Lovers' isn't just a slogan. It's a promise that even the most dedicated carnivores will find something to love in our products.",
