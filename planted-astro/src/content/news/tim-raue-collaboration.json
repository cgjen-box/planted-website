So when he approached us about featuring planted products at Restaurant Tim Raue in Berlin, we knew we had to deliver something extraordinary. The result: a series of exclusive dishes including a vegan Peking duck salad using planted.pulled, and Chicken with Jerusalem artichoke, hazelnut and truffle featuring planted.chicken.
