        "Prepare the ponzu dipping sauce by mixing soy sauce, fresh lemon and lime juice, mirin, and a touch of rice vinegar. Set aside.",
        "Season the planted.steak with salt and a light coating of neutral oil.",
        "Heat a cast-iron pan until smoking hot. Sear the steak for only 30-45 seconds per side to create a charred crust while keeping a rare center.",
        "Immediately transfer to an ice bath or cold plate to stop cooking. This creates the signature tataki texture.",
        "Once cooled, slice the steak as thinly as possible against the grain.",
        "Arrange slices on a chilled plate. Top with thinly sliced scallions, grated ginger, and toasted sesame seeds.",
        "Drizzle with ponzu sauce and serve immediately as an appetizer with pickled ginger on the side."
