        "Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta water before draining.",
        "Cut the planted into small lardons or cubes. Fry in a pan with olive oil until crispy and golden, about 5-6 minutes. Set aside.",
        "In a bowl, whisk together plant-based cream, nutritional yeast, a pinch of kala namak (black salt for eggy flavor), and plenty of freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Add the hot drained pasta to the pan with the planted. Remove from heat.",
        "Quickly pour the cream mixture over the pasta and toss vigorously, adding pasta water as needed to create a silky sauce. The residual heat will thicken the sauce.",
